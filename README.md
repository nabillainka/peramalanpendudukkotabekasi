## 🔍 **Introduction**
Among the many stories from my college days, my internship experience always stands out as the most memorable, from the challenges I faced, the people I met, to the unexpected lessons I learned. It was during those days filled with field notes and chasing deadlines that this research draft was born. After being neatly stored in my laptop folder for a long time, I am now bringing it back to the surface. It would be a shame if the experience and lessons learned were not shared. If there are parts that are inaccurate or need improvement, please do not hesitate to let me know so that we can all learn from it.

## 🔍 **Background**
The population of Bekasi City has increased significantly over the years. In 2022, the population of Bekasi City reached 2,590,257, an increase of 25,316 compared to the previous year. Bekasi City has an area of approximately 210.5 km², which is divided into 12 sub-districts, so that the increase in population has a direct impact on population density and the need for public facilities.

Forecasting the population is very important so that the government can make the right policies. With predictions of the future population, the government can:
- Identify potential problems such as traffic congestion, overcrowded settlements, clean water needs, health, education, and infrastructure.
- Determine more optimal development and public service strategies.
- Take advantage of opportunities in the fields of economy, investment, and spatial planning.

Therefore, it is necessary to analyze and forecast the population of Bekasi City for the coming years so that development planning can be carried out effectively and on target.

## 🔍 **Research Questions and Objectives**
### Research Questions
- What are the trends in the population of Bekasi City from 2008 to 2023?
- What are the results of population forecasting for 2024–2026 using the Brown method?
- How accurate are these forecasts?

### Research Objectives
- To determine the trend in population change in Bekasi City from 2008 to 2023.
- To forecast the population for the following years using the DES method.
- To analyze the accuracy of the forecast using MAPE.

### Scope of the Problem
- The data used only comes from the Bekasi City Statistics Agency in the publication “Kota Bekasi dalam Angka” (Bekasi City in Figures).
- The data period used is 2008–2023.
- The variable analyzed is only the population, not including socio-economic factors such as migration, birth rates, mortality rates, education, or infrastructure.
- The forecasting method used is Brown's Double Exponential Smoothing, without comparing it to other methods such as ARIMA, Moving Average, or Linear Trend.
- Data processing and calculations were performed using Microsoft Excel software.

## 🔍 **Conclusion and Recommendations**
### Conclusion
Based on the analysis results, the population of Bekasi City continues to increase until 2023 and shows an upward trend. The forecast results using Brown's Double Exponential Smoothing (DES) method indicate that population growth will continue to increase, although the rate of increase will begin to slow down. The forecast error value obtained is very small, with a MAPE value of 2.53%, so this method can be considered accurate and feasible to use.

### Recommendations
The Bekasi City Government is advised to:
- Provide housing solutions, particularly through the development of vertical housing.
- Improve the quality and capacity of transportation and public health services.
- Update and monitor population data regularly to support appropriate policies.
